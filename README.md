## Observer - Keep an eye on your server.
Keep an eye on your Discord server with **observer**. It logs key activities and keeps you updated in real-time.

## Features:
**Observer** carefully selects what to report, focusing only on the most essential activities to make moderation quick and efficient. To avoid being redundant **observer** ignores most of what Discord's built in Audit Logs record, keeping **observers** reports clean and easy to reference.

- **Moderation Alerts:** Logs bans and kicks with moderator details.
- **Message Monitoring:** Captures message edits and deletions.
- **Attachment & Link Tracking:** Reports all shared media, links, and code snippets.
- **Context & Navigation:** Observer provides detailed references, showing who performed actions and where they occurred. Whenever possible, it includes direct links to the channel and reported message, making moderation easier and more efficient.
- **Agnostic Reporting:** **Observer** records all activities in its designated categories without judgment, allowing you and your team to decide on any necessary actions.
- **Channel Flexibility:** Once the **observer** channel is created, you have the freedom to modify it however you see fit, without any limitations.
